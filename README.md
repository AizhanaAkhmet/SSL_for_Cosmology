# Compression of Cosmological Data and Inference with Self-Supervised Machine Learning
This repository contains the code used for the paper "Compression of Cosmological Data and Inference with Self-Supervised
Machine Learning" submitted to the ICML 2023 Workshop on Machine Learning for Astrophysics.

## Software dependencies and Datasets
This code uses \texttt{numpy}, \texttt{scipy}, and \texttt{pytorch} packages. The data for mock lognormal fields is generated with the powerbox package (https://powerbox.readthedocs.io/).
